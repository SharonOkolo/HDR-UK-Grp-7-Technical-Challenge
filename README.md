Breast cancer data exploration
Description: The simulacrum is a synthetic dataset that mimics English cancer patient data.
Task: Explore the breast cancer (C50) patients only in the set, relying on any supporting
information, and then summarise the data and any interesting findings for your audience.
Context: Assume your audience has a reasonable knowledge of healthcare but limited
cancer knowledge. You only have a short period of time so you’ll need to prioritise what you
tell them. Your audience may wish to use this data, so if you’re able to highlight the uses,
reliability and limitations of it then that would be helpful.
Hints: Start with simple information about the dataset, then build up to complex. You may
find it easier to take a few variables between team member.
Stretch options*: The reliability of the data would require to you find external literature, or
read through the technical reports to figure out. Likewise, many graphs are usually the best
way to present your findings. I would also consider looking at interactions/correlations
